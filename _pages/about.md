Welcome!

I am Katherine, a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering advised by Katharina Reinecke and Jon Froehlich. I graduated from Wake Forest University in 2019 and worked in industry as a Software Engineer for two years prior to pursuing a doctoral degree.

I am broadly intersted in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My current research projects aim to understand how culture clash is perceived by Latin American communities interacting with technology that embeds Western values. I also work in the field of accessibility where we build and access temporal tracking tools to understand how urban accessibility changes over time.
