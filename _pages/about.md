Welcome!

I am Katherine, a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) advised by [Katharina Reinecke](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/). I graduated from Wake Forest University in 2019 and worked in industry as a Software Engineer for two years prior to pursuing a doctoral degree.

I am broadly intersted in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and education. My current research aims to understand how information is disseminated by Latin American communities through digital technologies (i.e., social media) that may ingrain values differing from their own.
